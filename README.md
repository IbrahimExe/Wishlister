# üì± Wishlister üì±

</div>

**Wishlister** is a sleek, Steam‚Äëthemed mobile app built with **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**, A cataloging app designed for gamers to track, rate, and review their personal game collection, played or soon to be, AAA or indie!
> ‚ö†Ô∏è *This is a student project built entirely from scratch to practice Kotlin, Firebase integration, and Android UI/UX design. While it reuses some core concepts I learned during my [To Do List App](https://github.com/IbrahimExe/Kotlin_ToDoList_App) project, the Wishlister app was developed independently from the ground up!*

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Home & Collection View  
On launch, you arrive at **Your Collection**:  
- A two‚Äëcolumn grid of tall, CD‚Äëcase‚Äëstyle cards showing each game‚Äôs cover art made using Recycler Views.  
- If your collection is empty, a friendly message prompts you to add games.

- **Remove** button deletes the game (and its review) from your collection.  
- The background blends the game‚Äôs cover art into a Steam‚Äëstyle gradient.

## Firebase Integration

- **Authentication** (Would create a unique username & password for each user - anonymous testing for this demo).  
- **Realtime Database** under `/users/{uid}/games` stores:  
  - Game ID, name, played status, and review tied to each unique user (So Users can log in anywhere and keep thier notes saved!).  
- Live listeners keep your UI in sync whenever data changes.

## Learning Outcomes

Through building Wishlister, I gained hands‚Äëon experience with:

- **Kotlin fundamentals:** data classes, null safety, ViewBinding, and Activity lifecycles  
- **RecyclerView & Adapters:** creating custom view holders, handling click events, and grid layouts  
- **UI/UX Design:** crafting custom drawables, gradient backgrounds, pill‚Äëshaped buttons, and responsive layouts  
- **Firebase Integration:** setting up Realtime Database listeners, writing and reading structured data, and basic Authentication flows  
- **Animations & Transitions:** implementing fade‚Äëin effects and visual polish for a more engaging user experience  
- **Debugging & Data Handling:** filtering out null or orphaned entries, handling async callbacks, and improving app stability.
